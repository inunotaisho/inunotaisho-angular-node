# InuNoTaisho: Angular

This is the Angular 4 fullstack version of my website which is www.ebseiten.com.

Its about 52% of the way complete. It runs so long as you have `postegres` and `redis` running with sequelize files migrated

Plans are in the works to migrate the backend from `es5` to `TypeScript`.

First clone this repo. Before taking futher steps, make sure you have `nodejs` and `npm` installed. Then run `npm install` to install all required `node_modules`.

All modules a stored in `node_modules` and `webpack` is used as a module loader. The `webpack.config.env.js` is basic, but it does what we need. 

 Make sure you have `postgres` and `redis-server` running. Go into the `config folder` and either copy the 
dev database or change database to your desired name. Either way, the databse must be setup using something like `PgAdmin`or something similar. Command line control of `postgres` is also an option, but is not covered by this readme.

Once connected and `sequelize` migration files loaded in the database, run `redis-server` in another terminal tab. 
Redis is your session server and is vitale to for applications that require you to login or logout. 

Once finished, then and only then, can you run `npm start`.

Navigate to `localhost:5000` and you should be there.
